To run locally:

1) Clone the project from github and import the project into eclipse ide,
2) Convert into maven and build it
3) Run as boot application (port is 8080)
4) Go to http://localhost:8080/seacrh-hotels and enjoy :)

Known issue and missing functionalities
1) Not all the parameters are mpelmented in search
2) I needed to search the service by the offer travelStartDate/EndDate but no luck! maybe i did not guess the param name!3) Would be nice if i added a map using the location info of the hotel
